# Build Log

One entry per stage: what was built, what went wrong, and what was decided.

## Stage 1: Project setup (2026-10-09)

### What was built

- A NestJS 12 app in TypeScript with strict mode, created with the Nest CLI.
- `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 17 and Redis 7. Both have health checks, and both listen on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing outside this machine can reach them.
- A config module (`src/config/env.validation.ts`) that checks `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` at startup. It lists every problem in one error, rejects live Stripe keys and never prints secret values.
- Prisma 7 with the PostgreSQL driver adapter, wrapped in a global `PrismaService`.
- `GET /health`, which pings the database and returns 200 or 503.

### Problems and fixes

- **Ports already in use.** `docker compose up` failed with `Bind for 127.0.0.1:5432 failed: port is already allocated`. The job-tracker project's containers already used 5432 and 6379. Fix: this project uses 5435 and 6380, set in `.env`.
- **NestJS 12 ships Vitest, not Jest.** `PROJECT.md` names Jest, but the new scaffold is set up for Vitest and ES modules. Kept Vitest: the test code looks the same (`describe`, `it`, `expect`), and swapping it would mean fighting the framework's defaults.
- **Prisma's npm `latest` tag pointed at a release candidate** (`8.0.0-rc.22`). Pinned the last stable version, 7.10.0, instead.
- **`prisma init` added AI-agent skill folders** (`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.windsurf/`, `skills-lock.json`) and named its config `prisma7.config.ts`. Renamed the config to `prisma.config.ts`, the name the Prisma 7 docs use, and git-ignored the agent folders.
- **`prisma generate` failed without `DATABASE_URL`.** Prisma's `env()` helper throws when the variable is missing, which would break `npm install` in CI or a Docker build. Switched to `process.env.DATABASE_URL`; generating the client needs no database.
- **Empty error in the health check log.** Prisma's error message was blank when the database was down. The log now prints the error name and code, e.g. `PrismaClientKnownRequestError ECONNREFUSED`.

### Verified

- `npm test`: 15 unit tests pass. `npm run test:e2e`: 2 tests pass. `npm run build` and `npm run lint` are clean.
- With a variable removed from `.env`, the app exits with `"STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET" is required`.
- `/health` returned 200, then 503 after `docker compose stop postgres`, then 200 again after `docker compose start postgres`. The app kept running throughout.
